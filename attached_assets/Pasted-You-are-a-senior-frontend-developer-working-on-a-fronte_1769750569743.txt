You are a senior frontend developer working on a frontend-only CRM project.

IMPORTANT RULES (STRICT):
- This project has NO backend and NO database
- All data is currently stored in React state or localStorage
- DO NOT introduce backend, API, or database logic
- DO NOT change existing business logic
- DO NOT change role-based conditions
- ONLY enhance the UI by adding Kanban style

--------------------------------------------------

CURRENT TECH STACK:
- React + Vite
- Bootstrap 5
- Plain CSS files
- react-router-dom
- Role-based access (Admin, Manager, Employee)

--------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
Add Kanban-style workflow UI for Leads and Tasks
using existing frontend data only.

--------------------------------------------------

KANBAN REQUIREMENTS:

1. Kanban must be frontend-only.
2. Use existing status fields already present in data.
3. Data should continue working using:
   - React state OR
   - localStorage (if already used)
4. No backend logic allowed.
5. Existing table/list view must remain.
6. Add a toggle button:
   - Table View
   - Kanban View

--------------------------------------------------

KANBAN STRUCTURE TO ADD:

src/components/kanban/
│
├── KanbanBoard.jsx
├── KanbanColumn.jsx
├── KanbanCard.jsx
└── Kanban.css

--------------------------------------------------

KANBAN COLUMNS:

Leads:
- New
- Contacted
- Follow Up
- Converted
- Lost

Tasks:
- To Do
- In Progress
- Completed

--------------------------------------------------

ROLE-BASED RULES (MUST REMAIN UNCHANGED):

- Admin → sees all cards
- Manager → sees assigned team data
- Employee → sees only own leads and tasks

Reuse existing role-based filtering logic exactly as implemented.

--------------------------------------------------

KANBAN FUNCTIONALITY:

- Group items by status and render into columns
- Display each item as a card
- Each card should show:
  - Name
  - Status
  - Owner (if available)
- Allow status change using:
  - Dropdown OR
  - Button (drag and drop optional)

When status changes:
- Update React state
- Persist changes in localStorage if already used

--------------------------------------------------

UI RULES:

- Use Bootstrap grid system
- No Tailwind
- No inline styles
- Use Kanban.css only
- Design must be clean and professional

--------------------------------------------------

FINAL RESULT EXPECTED:

- App must compile without errors
- All existing pages must work exactly as before
- Kanban is an additional UI feature
- Project remains frontend-only
- Code structure must look like a real company CRM frontend

Act as if this frontend will later be connected to a backend, but for now everything stays client-side only.
